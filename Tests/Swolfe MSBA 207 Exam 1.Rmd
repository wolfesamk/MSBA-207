```{r libs, include=TRUE}
library(glmnet)
library(foreach)
set.seed(123)
```

## Loading the data

```{r dataload, include=TRUE}
train_X <- read.csv('E:/Aliit/School/MSBA/207/MSBA-207/Tests/train_X.csv')
train_y <- read.csv('E:/Aliit/School/MSBA/207/MSBA-207/Tests/train_y.csv')
valid_X <- read.csv('E:/Aliit/School/MSBA/207/MSBA-207/Tests/valid_X.csv')
valid_y <- read.csv('E:/Aliit/School/MSBA/207/MSBA-207/Tests/valid_y.csv')
```

## Preparing the data

```{r prep, include=TRUE}
train.df <- cbind(train_X,train_y)
valid.df <- cbind(valid_X,valid_y)


y <- train.df$TenYearCHD
X <- model.matrix(TenYearCHD ~ ., train.df)[, -1] #remove intercept as glmnet will add intercept
```

## Models

#### Lasso L1

```{r lasso L1, include=TRUE}
# Find the best lambda using cross-validation

cv.lasso <- cv.glmnet(X, y, alpha = 1, family = "binomial")
# Fit the final model on the training data
model <- glmnet(X, y, alpha = 1, family = "binomial",
                lambda = cv.lasso$lambda.min)
# Display regression coefficients
round(coef(model),5)
```

#### Lasso with CV

```{r lasso with cs, include=TRUE}
a <- seq(0.1, 0.9, 0.05)
search <- foreach(i = a, .combine = rbind) %dopar% {
  cv <- cv.glmnet(X, y, family = "binomial", nfold = 10, type.measure = "deviance", paralle = FALSE, 
                  alpha = i)
  data.frame(cvm = cv$cvm[cv$lambda == cv$lambda.1se], lambda.1se = cv$lambda.1se, alpha = i)
}
cv3 <- search[search$cvm == min(search$cvm), ]
md3 <- glmnet(X, y, family = "binomial", lambda = cv3$lambda.1se, alpha = cv3$alpha)
round(coef(md3),5)
```

#### 10b.e

Looking at the coefs I would say that selecting the correct category in conjunction with having an auction duration of 5 days would result in the highest rate of competitive auctions.
